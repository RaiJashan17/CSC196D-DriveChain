  "description": "Yesterday evening, I parked my car along the curb near a shopping center while I ran inside for groceries. When I came back about 30 minutes later, I saw that someone had scratched words into the paint on the passenger door and broken one of the side mirrors. There was also a small dent on the rear panel, as if it had been kicked. The car was locked and nothing inside was taken. I contacted the store’s security office and filed a police report right away, providing photos of the damage for documentation.",
