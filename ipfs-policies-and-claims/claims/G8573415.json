  "description": "When I returned to my car in the morning, I found that it had been vandalized overnight while parked on the street outside my building. The driver’s side door was deeply scratched with what looked like a key or sharp object, and the side mirror had been broken off. There was also spray paint across the rear panel. I didn’t see anyone around at the time, but I reported the incident to the police and filed a report. The car had been locked and parked legally, and no valuables were visible inside. This was the first time anything like this has happened in my neighborhood.",
