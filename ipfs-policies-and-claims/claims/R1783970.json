  "description": "I parked my car in the driveway at home around 10 p.m. after getting back from running errands. When I went outside the next morning, it was gone. The driveway gate was closed, and there was no broken glass or sign of forced entry, which makes me think someone may have used a signal jammer or key cloning device. I called the police right away to file a report. The car was in good working condition and had a few personal items inside. I still have both sets of keys and didn’t give anyone permission to use the vehicle.",
