  "description": "Last night, I parked my car on a well-lit street near my friend’s house around 8 p.m. When I came back a few hours later, it was gone. I initially thought I might have parked on the wrong block, but after checking the entire area, it was clear the car had been stolen. I called the police to file a report and gave them the vehicle’s registration and VIN. The car was locked, and I had both keys with me. There were no broken glass fragments or signs of a break-in where I parked, so the thief may have used an electronic device to unlock it.",
