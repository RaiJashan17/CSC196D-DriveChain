  "description": "I parked my car in the office parking lot around 8 a.m. and went inside for work as usual. When I came back out just after 5 p.m., the car was gone. I double-checked with security and they confirmed it hadn’t been towed or moved. The security cameras showed a person walking up to the vehicle around midday, getting in, and driving away within seconds — it looked like they used some kind of device to unlock it. I immediately contacted the police and filed a theft report. I still have my keys and no one else had permission to drive the car. The vehicle was locked, in good condition, and contained some personal items in the glove compartment.",
