  "description": "When I came out to my car early this morning, I discovered that it had been vandalized overnight while parked in front of my apartment. Someone had smashed the rear windshield and spray-painted the driver’s side door with graffiti. There were also deep scratches along the back panel. I immediately called the police and filed a report. Nothing appeared to have been stolen from inside, and the car was locked when I parked it. This area has had a few similar incidents recently, so I wanted to report it right away for documentation and repair.",
