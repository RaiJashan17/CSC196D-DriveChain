  "description": "Two nights ago, I parked my car outside a restaurant while meeting friends for dinner. When I came back about two hours later, the car was no longer there. At first, I thought it might have been towed, but the restaurant manager confirmed there were no tow orders for that area. I called the police immediately to report the theft. The vehicle was locked, the alarm was set, and I still have both keys. Security footage from a nearby shop showed someone getting into the car and driving off within seconds. The car was in good condition, with a few personal belongings left inside.",
