  "description": "Last Tuesday around 5:30 p.m., I was heading east through the green light at the Maple & 3rd intersection when a white Honda Civic coming north ran the red and hit my car on the driver’s side near the front wheel. Traffic was moderate and the roads were dry. I was traveling about 25–30 mph; I braked and sounded the horn but didn’t have enough distance to avoid the impact. The other driver pulled over immediately and apologized, saying they “didn’t see the light change.” We exchanged insurance information, I took photos of both vehicles and the intersection, and I called the police to file an accident report. My car has damage to the front-left fender, headlight, and door, and it needed to be towed. I was wearing my seatbelt and did not receive medical treatment at the scene.",
