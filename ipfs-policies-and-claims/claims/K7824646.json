  "description": "I parked my car in a public garage downtown last night, and when I returned this morning, the windshield was smashed and all four tires had been slashed. It looks like someone intentionally damaged it, since other nearby cars were also vandalized. I notified the garage security and the police, and they reviewed the cameras to document the incident. Nothing was stolen from inside, but the vehicle will need glass replacement and new tires before it can be driven again.",
  "incidentType": "Vandalism"
