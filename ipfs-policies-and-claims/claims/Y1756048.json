  "description": "Last weekend, while my car was parked outside my workplace overnight, someone vandalized it. The windshield was cracked, the paint on the hood was keyed, and one of the headlights had been smashed. There was also dried soda poured over the roof and doors. I discovered the damage the next morning and immediately reported it to the building’s security and local police. The car was locked, and nothing appeared to have been stolen from inside.",
