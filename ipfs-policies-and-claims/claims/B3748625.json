  "description": "Last Friday evening, I parked my car on the street near my apartment and locked it as usual. When I came outside the next morning, the car was gone. There were no broken windows or signs of damage — it just wasn’t there anymore. I called the police immediately to file a theft report. The officer mentioned that a few vehicles in the neighborhood had been stolen recently. I still have both sets of keys, and I hadn’t given anyone permission to use the car. It was in good condition, had fuel, and there were a few personal items left inside at the time.",
