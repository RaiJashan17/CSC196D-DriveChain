  "description": "Earlier this week, I was driving through an intersection when another vehicle turned left across my lane without signaling. I braked immediately but still collided with their passenger side. The impact crumpled my front bumper and damaged the hood and headlights. Both drivers pulled over, and we exchanged insurance information. The police came to the scene and filed a report. Road conditions were clear, and I was traveling within the speed limit. My car was towed for inspection since it wasn’t drivable after the accident.",
